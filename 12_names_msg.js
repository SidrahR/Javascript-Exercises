//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

var names = ["Humaira", "Mirrah", "Ali", "Suleman"];

for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
  console.log("Glad to see you in my assignment "+ names[i]);
}
