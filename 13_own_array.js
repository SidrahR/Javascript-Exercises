//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

var my_array = ["Car", "Plane", "Cycle"];

console.log("I have a blue " + my_array[0]);
console.log("I traveled through a " + my_array[1]);
console.log("My " + my_array[2] + " broke yesterday");
